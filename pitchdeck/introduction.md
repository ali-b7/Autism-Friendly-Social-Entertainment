## Who are we?

Group members: Ali Badran, Franziscka Wojtkowski, Paya Karimi, Paniz Ziaie. 

We are a group of 4th semester health informatics students passionate about leveraging technology to improve the quality of life for individuals with autism and their families. Our team combines expertise in healthcare, technology, business management and user experience design.  to create a platform that addresses the unique challenges faced by parents and caregivers of autistic children.


## Our Mission

Our mission is to revolutionize the entertainment landscape for autistic children and their families by delivering a comprehensive, inclusive platform that simplifies the search for suitable venues. Leveraging advanced filtering options, real-time occupancy updates, and community-driven insights, we are committed to enhancing accessibility and enriching experiences. Our goal is to foster a supportive ecosystem that empowers caregivers and ensures every child has access to safe, enjoyable, and tailored entertainment opportunities.


## Why should we care?

Caring about our project is essential because it directly impacts the lives of autistic children and their families, who often face significant challenges in finding suitable entertainment venues. These families are frequently underserved, resulting in limited opportunities for social engagement and enjoyment. By creating a platform that caters specifically to their sensory needs, we are fostering a more inclusive and compassionate society. Our project ensures that every child, regardless of their sensory sensitivities, can experience joy, social interaction, and a sense of belonging in their community. This isn't just about providing a serviceâ€”it's about championing the rights of autistic children to have equal access to enriching experiences, promoting social inclusion, and supporting caregivers in their journey. By caring about this project, we are taking a stand for inclusivity, empathy, and the well-being of all children.
